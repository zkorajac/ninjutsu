                 <p> In 1996, I began training in taekwondo (a traditional Korean martial art) before spending one year in the Croatian army. After returning from the army, my desire to learn martial arts had grown, but I wasn't interested in continuing with taekwondo because for some reason I was unfulfilled with it. I began visiting various martial arts clubs, and would always say that I would return, but did not. I was not attracted to any of those martial arts.
                 </p>
                  <p>About a year later, I saw an ad for a two-day ninjutsu seminar on the last page of a martial arts magazine. I was very impressed with the techniques demonstrated in the opening demonstration. The words came into my mind, "I want that!" I value the discipline I have learned through my training in the art of ninjutsu, and will continue to learn and practice throughout my life. I am excited to share and teach the principles and techniques that have become so valuable to me.
                  </P>

                  <p>Sweneric Bogsater; Part of today's modern martial arts are the Bonsai. They are made to look certain way. Ninjutsu is for me a wild nature. Follows a certain cycle, everything has its own place and is natural. Bonsai is beautiful but nothing compared to nature.</p>
